# Design Document

## Overview

This design outlines the systematic expansion of the Fact Frenzy trivia game's question database from 25 to 125 questions. The expansion focuses on maintaining high-quality, entertaining fun facts while ensuring proper categorization, difficulty distribution, and seamless integration with the existing game architecture.

## Architecture

### Question Database Structure

The expanded question database will maintain the existing TypeScript interface while scaling content volume:

```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  correctAnswer: number;
  explanation: string;
  category: string;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
}
```

### Content Organization Strategy

**Systematic ID Management:**
- Continue sequential numbering from q26 to q125
- Maintain consistent ID format for easy tracking
- Ensure no duplicate IDs in the expanded database

**Category Distribution Plan:**
- Animals: ~25 questions (existing + new)
- Geography: ~25 questions (existing + new)
- Science: ~25 questions (existing + new)
- History: ~20 questions (existing + new)
- Culture & Miscellaneous: ~25 questions (new category expansion)

**Difficulty Level Distribution:**
- Easy: ~50 questions (40% of total)
- Medium: ~50 questions (40% of total)
- Hard: ~25 questions (20% of total)

## Components and Interfaces

### Question Content Guidelines

**Fun Facts Criteria:**
- Focus on surprising, entertaining, or "wow factor" information
- Include verifiable facts with interesting explanations
- Avoid common knowledge that most people already know
- Prioritize memorable and conversation-worthy content

**Question Quality Standards:**
- Clear, unambiguous wording
- Four distinct multiple choice options
- One obviously correct answer
- Three plausible but incorrect distractors
- Engaging explanations that add educational value

### Category-Specific Content Themes

**Animals Category Expansion:**
- Unusual animal behaviors and abilities
- Record-holding animals (fastest, largest, smallest)
- Surprising animal facts and adaptations
- Extinct species and evolutionary oddities

**Geography Category Expansion:**
- Extreme geographical features and records
- Unusual country and city facts
- Natural phenomena and formations
- Cultural geography and human settlements

**Science Category Expansion:**
- Space and astronomy facts
- Human body and biology surprises
- Physics and chemistry phenomena
- Technology and invention history

**History Category Expansion:**
- Lesser-known historical events
- Surprising facts about famous figures
- Ancient civilizations and cultures
- Historical inventions and discoveries

**Culture & Miscellaneous Category:**
- Food and cuisine facts
- Language and communication oddities
- Sports and entertainment trivia
- Modern culture and social phenomena

## Data Models

### Enhanced Question Database Schema

```typescript
// Extended question database with 125 questions
export const expandedQuestions: Question[] = [
  // Existing 25 questions (q1-q25)
  ...sampleQuestions,
  
  // New 100 questions (q26-q125)
  // Organized by category and difficulty
];

// Category distribution tracking
interface CategoryStats {
  animals: number;
  geography: number;
  science: number;
  history: number;
  culture: number;
}

// Difficulty distribution tracking
interface DifficultyStats {
  easy: number;
  medium: number;
  hard: number;
}
```

### Question Validation Schema

```typescript
interface QuestionValidation {
  hasUniqueId: boolean;
  hasValidOptions: boolean;
  hasCorrectAnswerIndex: boolean;
  hasExplanation: boolean;
  hasCategory: boolean;
  hasDifficulty: boolean;
}

// Validation function for new questions
const validateQuestion = (question: Question): QuestionValidation => {
  return {
    hasUniqueId: question.id.length > 0,
    hasValidOptions: question.options.length === 4,
    hasCorrectAnswerIndex: question.correctAnswer >= 0 && question.correctAnswer <= 3,
    hasExplanation: question.explanation.length > 0,
    hasCategory: question.category.length > 0,
    hasDifficulty: ['easy', 'medium', 'hard'].includes(question.difficulty)
  };
};
```

## Error Handling

### Content Quality Assurance

**Question Validation Process:**
- Verify all questions follow the established format
- Ensure correct answer indices are valid (0-3)
- Validate that explanations provide meaningful context
- Check for appropriate difficulty classification

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- Implement ID uniqueness validation
- Check for similar question content to avoid repetition
- Ensure variety in question topics within categories

**Performance Considerations:**
- Maintain efficient random selection with larger dataset
- Ensure question loading doesn't impact game startup time
- Optimize memory usage for expanded question array

## Testing Strategy

### Content Validation Testing

**Automated Validation:**
- TypeScript compilation checks for interface compliance
- Unit tests for question format validation
- Automated checks for ID uniqueness and answer index validity

**Manual Content Review:**
- Fact-checking for accuracy of all new questions
- Review explanations for clarity and educational value
- Verify appropriate difficulty classification

**Game Integration Testing:**
- Test random question selection with expanded database
- Verify game sessions maintain variety with larger pool
- Ensure no performance degradation with 125 questions

### Quality Assurance Process

**Content Creation Workflow:**
1. Research and compile interesting fun facts
2. Format questions according to established schema
3. Write engaging explanations with additional context
4. Classify difficulty level based on knowledge requirements
5. Assign appropriate category classification
6. Validate format and uniqueness

**Review and Refinement:**
- Peer review for question quality and accuracy
- Test questions with sample audiences for difficulty validation
- Refine wording for clarity and engagement
- Ensure cultural sensitivity and inclusivity
